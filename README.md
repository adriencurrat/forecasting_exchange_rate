## Introduction
This project replicates a real-world forecasting exercise conducted in the context of the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Acting as a macroeconomic forecasting team, we forecasted the evolution of the Swiss nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) of Switzerland up to 2026.

Using a theoretical framework based on the Taylor rule and the uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition, we assessed the impact of inflation and output gap differentials on bilateral exchange rates with major trading partners (US, EU, China, and UK), weighted by trade importance. The results showed that the model delivered accurate forecasts and outperformed a random walk.

This project received the maximum grade in the course. The work was also highlighted by Professor Grobéty in a public [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7275406513182060545/), acknowledging the quality of the analysis.
